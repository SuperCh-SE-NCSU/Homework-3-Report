## Theory1: COCOMO
#### List1: Scale factors

- Prec: Precedentness. 
> Precedentness indicates whether current work is highly based on previous work or not. If so, there will be less effort, because people will tend to be familiar with previous work. Otherwise more effort will be needed.

- Flex: Development flexibility.
> Development flexibility indicates whether one team can accept the changes of development requirements well or not. If the flexibility of one team is high, when requirements change, there will be less effort for them to adapt to new requirements.

- Resl: Rish resolution.
> Resl indicates whether one team has carried out enough risk analysis or not. If so, that team will understand their project's risk more precisely, and will take less effort.

- Team: Team cohension.
> Team indicates whether one team has high team cohension or not. If so, conflicts between team members will be less. Hence, the effort will also be reduced.

- Pmat: Process maturity.
> Pmat indicates whether one team is familiar with the development process or not. If so, they will have less errors occured, and take less effort to finish the project.

#### List2: Upside effort multipliers -- the things that, if increased, add to the development effort
- rely: Required software reliability
> If one team want to have high "rely", they have to do many more work, such as writing and passing different kinds of tests, considering security issues, and so on. These things will require more effort.

- data: Database size.
> If one team need bigger DB size, they have to ensure the relationship between different tables is OK. Also they should optimize the processing time of DB. These things will absoluately require more effort.

- cplx: program complexity
> "cplx" is one of the product attributes too. Obviously, increasing the program complexity adds the development effort.

- ruse: developed for reusability
> When we're required to develop a product with higher resuabulity, we have to pay more effort in the development process, especailly in the design, coding stages.

- docu: document requirements
> Increasing the document requirements leads to more time in writing, polishing the product documents, thus adds to the effort.

- time: runtime presssure
> Developing a "ns" responsbile system is more difficult than developing a "ms" respobsible system. Because we have to optimize the structure, algorithm, etc. so that our system can reponse faster. This can adds the effort.

- stor: main storage constraints
> Higher "stor" indicates more main storge constraints, such as less main storage space. Under this circumstance, the developer have to optimize the data structure or algorithms, therefore, adds the efforts.

- pvol: platform volatility
> Changing the platform frequently adds the developing difficulty. Because that increases the personnel training cost and increases the difficulty of scheduling development timetable.
